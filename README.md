# Welcome to RALI - Raul Adriaensen Learning and Innovation (RALI) hub

This organisation has been created with the primary intention of giving a structured approach to my learning interest while also sharing my work with the world in the hope these ideas can become foundations for other projects and inspire others to share their work and interests. Every repository should be self contained and reproducible.

The naming **RALI** comes as inspiration from rally / racing sports which I enjoy but also reflect some qualities that I should focus on in my learning journey such as:
- **endurance in learning:** improving my knowledge and skillset base is a long term commitment that should be worked on everyday
- **focused navigation:** I have a passion to learn about everything, but I know that I will benefit most from keeping a clear direction
- **strategic plannig:** In the spirit of keeping a clear direction, I should plan, think and reiterate upon what projects I want to cover, and perhaps return to them over time
- **fun and engaging:** I want these projects to bring some variety to my PhD studies, in this spirit and to broaden my learning horizons most repositories will be usually 1 day coding projects. This sets a sensible level of quality ambitions. To address engagement I will reshare a brief article with my findings, learnings and best references for others via LinkedIn.

# Project brainstorming

The following list will be ever-evolving and allows me to keep track of any projects I would like to do. As a project is completed I will attached a link to its respective repository:
- like GYWIZ GEE page, the github repo looks flawless, how can I similarly reproduce this. Simple task on 1
- What are good places and resources for me to gain idea
